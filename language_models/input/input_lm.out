in computing a file system or is used to control how data is stored and retrieved
without a file system information placed in a storage medium would be one large body of data with no way to tell where one piece of information stops and the next begins
by separating the data into pieces and giving each piece a name the information is easily isolated and identified
taking its name from the way information systems are named each group of data is called a file
the structure and logic rules used to manage the groups of information and their names is called a file system

create the if they do not already exist
arguments to long options are for short options too
m
set file mode as in not
p parents
no error if existing make parent as needed

the matrix is a science film written and directed by the moss weaving and joe

a newspaper is a publication containing news about current events other informative articles about politics sports arts and so on and
a newspaper is usually but not exclusively printed on relatively paper such as
the organizations that publish newspapers are themselves often called newspapers
as of most newspapers are now published online as well as in print
the online are called online newspapers or news
newspapers are typically published daily or weekly
news magazines are also weekly but they have a magazine format
newspapers typically publish news articles and feature articles on national and international news as well as local news
the news includes political events and personalities business and finance crime weather and natural health and medicine science and computers and sports and entertainment society food and cooking clothing and home fashion and the arts
for most file systems a program access to a file in a file system using the open system call
this resources associated to the file the file and returns a handle that the process will use to refer to that file
in some cases the open is performed by the first access
the same file may be opened simultaneously by several processes and even by the same process resulting in several file for the same file depending on the file organization and
operations on the such as moving the file pointer or closing it are independent they do not affect other for the same file
operations on the file like a write can be seen by operations on the other a read can read the written data
during the open the may memory for or it may wait until the first operation
the absolute is resolved
this may include connecting to a remote host and an that a removable medium is required
it may include the initialization of a communication device
at this point an error may be returned if the host or medium is not available
the first access to at least the directory within the is performed
an error will usually be returned if the higher level components of the path cannot be located or
an error will be returned if the file is expected to exist and it does not or if the file should not already exist and it does
if the file is expected to exist and it does the file access as restricted by permission flags within the file data or access control list is against the requested type of operations
this usually requires an additional access although in some may be part of the directory structure
if the file is being created the may the default initial amount of storage or a specified amount depending on the file system
if this fails an error will be returned
the directory with the new entry may be performed or it may be until the close is performed
various other errors which may occur during the open include directory update multiple media communication link and device
the return value must always be examined and an error specific action taken
in many cases programming library opens may perform additional actions including a library structure related to the file
as soon as a file is no longer needed the program should close it
this will cause library and to be updated to the physical media and other processes to access the data if exclusive use had been required
some may close a file if the program calls the exit
some may perform the necessary operations if the program terminates
neither of these is likely to take place in the event of a kernel or power failure
this can cause requiring the running of privileged and during which the entire may be inaccessible
remove files or
this manual page documents the version of
each specified
file
by default it does not remove
if the i or option is given and there are more than three
files or the r r or are given then prompts the user for
whether to proceed with the entire operation
if the response is not
the entire command is
otherwise if a file is standard input is a terminal and the f or
force option is not given or the i or option is given
prompts the user for whether to remove the file
if the response is not
affirmative the file is skipped
a computer terminal is an electronic or hardware device that is used for entering data into and data from a computer or a computing system
early were devices but very slow compared to cards or paper tape for input but as the improved and were introduced pushed these older forms of interaction from the industry
a related development was systems which in parallel and made up for any of the users typing ability with the ability to support multiple users on the same machine each at their own terminal
the of sound waves and audio signals which to the volume refers to the of the air pressure in the wave but sometimes the of the movements of the air or the of a speaker is described
the of the squared is usually quoted in so a corresponds to

the square of the is proportional to the intensity of the wave
